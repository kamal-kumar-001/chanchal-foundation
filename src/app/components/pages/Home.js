          Founded in memory of Chanchal Yadav by Vijay Veer Sunaria, Chanchal Veer Foundation is dedicated to social service, organizing medical and blood donation camps.
<br />
<br />
          The Foundation, registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, also provides free blood to girls under one year old in Rewari, aiming to improve medical conditions in society. Haryanvi actor Kuldeep Kaushik (KD), our brand ambassador, attended the camp, which was praised by all participants.
          <br />
<br />
          Vijay Veer Sunaria encourages everyone to join the Foundation to enhance our social service efforts, with many community members already pledging their support.<br />
